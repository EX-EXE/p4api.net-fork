//// for osx using clion to debug 
// lookup a p4api symbol to find where the source was when built
(lldb) image lookup -vn Enviro

// Get a lot of output, look for this output which tells you what directory the library was built in:
//  CompileUnit: id = {0x00000000}, file = "/private/var/tmp/132407837/depot/r21.1/p4/sys/enviro.cc", language = "unknown"

// now configure source map, attaching build directory to source file,  allowing clion and lldb to debug through the p4api
(lldb) settings set -- target.source-map /private/var/tmp/132407837/depot/r21.1/p4 /Users/nmorse/Perforce/nmorse_ws_new/depot/r21.1/p4
